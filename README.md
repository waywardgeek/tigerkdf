TwoCats and SkinnyCat
=====================

TwoCats is sequential memory and compute time hard password hashing scheme that maximizes
an attackers time*memory cost for guessing passwords.  Christian Forler and Alexander
Peslyak (aka SolarDesigner) provided most of the ideas that I have combined in TwoCats.
While they may not want credit for this work, it belongs to them more than me.

SkinnyCat is a compatible stripped-down version of TwoCats supporting only a memory cost.
It is meant to be simple to implement, yet provide fast memory-hard password security.

Please read TwoCats.odt for a description of the algorithm and credits for ideas.
