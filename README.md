TwoCats
=======

TwoCats is a sequential memory and compute time hard password hashing scheme that
maximizes an attackers time*memory cost for guessing passwords.  Christian Forler and
Alexander Peslyak (aka SolarDesigner) provided most of the ideas that I have combined in
TwoCats.  While they may not want credit for this work, it belongs to them more than me.

Please read TwoCats.odt for a description of the algorithm and credits for ideas.
