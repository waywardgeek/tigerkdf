    This is the TwoCats password hashing scheme.  Most users will find the
    simple TwoCats_HashPassword interface sufficient.  More advanced users who
    want control should use TwoCats_HashPasswordFull.  If you know what you are
    doing and want bare metal control, use TwoCats_HashPasswordExtended.

    For all of these functions, these are the restrictions on sizes:

    hash is 32 or 64 bytes, depending on the selelected hashType
    memCost <= 30
    multiplies <= 8
    1 <= prallelism <= 255
    startMemCost <= stopMemCost <= 30
    oldMemCost < newMemCost <= 30
    32 <= subBlockSize <= blockSize <= 2^20 -- both must be powers of 2
    1 <= lanes <= hash size/4 (for example, 8 for SHA256)

    NULL values and 0 lengths are legal for all variable sized inputs.  Lengths
    for NULL values must be 0.

    Preferably, passwords and any other secret data are passed in fixed sized
    buffers.  This insures that SHA256 can not leak length information.

    The password and salt are always overwritten with 0's at the beginning of
    hashing, to reduce the damage of "garbage-collector" attacks where memory
    is leaked to an attacker.

   This is the extended password hashing interface for those who know what they
   are doing.  Consider running twocats-guessparams to find reasonalbe default
   values for a given memory cost for your specific machine.

   memory is a pointer to the allocated memory area do memory-hard hashing.  If
   NULL, TwoCats will allocate memory on it's own.  It _must_ be allined to a
   512 bit boundary, or some SIMD instructions will fail.

   Data can be any application specific data, such as a secondary key or
   application name, or a concatenation of various data.

   startMemCost is normally equal to stopMemCost, unless a password hash has
   been strengthened using TwoCats_UpdatePassword.
   
   stopMemCost is the main memory hashing difficulty parameter, which causes
   2^stopMemCost KiB of memory to be hashed.  Each increment doubles memory and
   difficulty.
   
   multiplies is used to force attackers to run each guess as long as you do.
   It should be set as high as possible without increasing runtime
   significantly.  3 is a reasonable default for hashing memory sizes larger
   than the CPU cache size, 2 is reasonable for L2/L3 cache sizes, and 1 is
   good for L1 cache sizes significantly.  For CPUs without hardware
   multiplication or on-chip data cache, multiplies should be set to 0.

   lanes is used to make use of SIMD parallelism available on the CPU, such as
   SSE2 and AVX2.  Older CPUs without any SIMD unit should set lanes to 1.
   Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge Intel processors run best with lanes set to 4.
   Haswell runs best with lanes set to 8.

   parallelism is the number of threads used in parallel to hash the password.
   A reasonable number is half the CPU cores you expect to have idle at any
   time, but it must be at least 1.  Each thread hashes memory so fast, you
   likely will maximize memory bandwidth with only 2 threads.  Higher values
   can be used on multi-CPU servers with more than two memory banks to increase
   password security.

   overwriteCost is the cost used to throw away memory early, to provide some
   protection in case memory is leaked to an attacker.  The default of 6 causes
   about 3% of the early memory to be overwritten.  Setting it to 0 will
   disable this feature.

   If clearData is true, the data is set to 0's early in hashing, when we clear
   the password and salt.

   The final parameter, sideChannelResistant should probably be false for most
   use cases, even in cloud based password managers.  Some use cases, such as
   protecting passwords embedded in a hardware token, require that an attacker
   not see password-dependent information, even with an oscilloscope on the
   power rails.  In this case, sideChannelResistant should be set.  The
   down-side is that off-line brute-force guessing attacks will then be weakned
   by 2-3X.
